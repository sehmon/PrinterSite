# PrinterSite
The site teachers use to find printers

Simple website for my school to help teachers find the printers throughtout the campus. Uses Python and Flask to manage a .CSV file of all the printers on campus. Adds the printers to a nice webpage and gives clear instructions on how to add the printer to your laptop.
